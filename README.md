## Features

yquery is ... blah blah blah


## Installation

Currently yquery does not reside in any package manager that I know of. So in order to install it you need to download a prebuilt binary release or built it yourself.

### Downloading
You can download prebuilt binaries in the
[releases section](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei/releases).

### Building
You can also build and install from source (requires the latest stable [Rust] compiler.)
```console
cargo install --git https://github.com/madsravn/yquery.git yquery
```

[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org
